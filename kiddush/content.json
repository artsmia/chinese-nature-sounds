  "title": "Friday-night Kiddush Sung in Hebrew",
  "description": "Kiddush, which means holiness, is the prayer over wine (or grape juice) that sanctifies Shabbat. On Friday night, the kiddush is recited over a full cup of wine or grape juice before sitting down for Shabbat dinner and before saying the motzi, the blessing over the challah. After the kiddush is recited, the cup is passed around so that everyone can take a sip from it.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the kiddush is said after services and before lunch. The Shabbat-morning version of the kiddush focuses on God's commandment for Jews to observe the Sabbath and make it holy.\n\nText courtesy of MyJewishLearning.com, lightly edited with input from Rabbi Alexander Davis of Beth El Synagogue, St. Louis Park.
